Editor war is the common name for the rivalry between users of the vi 
and Emacs text editors. The rivalry has become a lasting part of hacker 
culture and the free software community.

Many flame wars have been fought between groups insisting that their editor 
of choice is the paragon of editing perfection, and insulting the others. 
Unlike the related battles over operating systems, programming languages, 
and even source code indent style, choice of editor usually only affects 
oneself.

Benefits of vi-like editors

1. Historically, vi is faster than Emacs.
2. Runs on all systems that can implement the standard C library, including 
UNIX, Linux, AmigaOS, DOS, Windows, Mac, BeOS, and POSIX-compliant systems.
3. Allows users of the QWERTY keyboard to keep their fingers on the home row, 
thus requiring less movement and less time to edit.
4. Ubiquitous. Essentially all Unix and Unix-like systems come with vi (or a 
variant) built-in.

Benefits of Emacs

1. One of the most ported non-trivial computer programs. It runs on a wide 
variety of operating systems, including most Unix-like systems (GNU/Linux, 
the various BSDs, Solaris, AIX, IRIX, AmigaOS, Mac OS X etc.), MS-DOS, 
Microsoft Windows and OpenVMS. Unix systems, both free and proprietary, 
frequently provide Emacs bundled with the operating system.
2. Extensible and customizable, with features that include:
  a. Ability to emulate vi (known as "viper-mode").
  b. A powerful and extensible file manager (dired), integrated debugger, 
  and a large set of tools to work with.
